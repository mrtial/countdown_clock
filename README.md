# COUNTDOWM CLOCK

### TIME

The total coding time is approximately 50 mins. It took a about 15 mins to setup the basic countdown function. But I forgot to adjust local timezone at first, and I also added 'adjust singular' function to the unit when the number is "01" or "00". The rest of time I spent in styling the clock.

### TOOL & TECHNOLOGIES USED

Pure HTML, CSS & Google Font. 

This is a relatively simple function. Do not have many DOM manipulation or other interactive function. Therefore, I choose not to load extra script like jQuery or to use Angular. But I do load a google font. I like the cleaness of this font.


### BUGS/ IMPROVEMENTS

I don't see any bug. 

I try to style the clock in several different way, but I decide to go with something simple and clean. But if I have more time, I would like to add more styling and maybe animation to the clock.

Also, it would be more useful if user can set their onw target time. And it would nice to show the location(timezone) at the bottom.
